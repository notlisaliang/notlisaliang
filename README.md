### Aspiring Software Engineer 

Technical Account Manager at Adobe, guiding F500 clients to optimize marketing automation processes and strategies through Marketo Engage.

I'm currently building the technical and conceptual foundation to transition into Software Engineering, with a focus on behavioral science and digital wellbeing. Long-term, I aim to create responsible, empathetic technologies that address real-world challenges like addiction, isolation, and misinformation. Passionate about using tech for good, Iâ€™m pursuing deeper skills in algorithms, system analysis, and formal reasoning to turn that vision into reality.

- ðŸŒ± I am currently working at Adobe's Applications Engineering team as an Associate Technical Account Manager.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love reading, particularly non-fiction books relating to history and science! My current read is "TThe Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power" by Daniel Yergin.
